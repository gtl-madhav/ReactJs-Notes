# ReactJs-Notes

Reactjs shines in building dynamic and engaging web interfaces and triumphs over other javascript frameworks (such as Angular, Ember). The reason is: Virtual DOM facilitates updating components whenever a user does any interaction without affecting other parts of the interface.

“After having used static HTML based pages for over 20 years, we are finally able to build web pages that render server-side, navigate quickly, and consume lesser development time. Thanks to React!”

React enables developers to reuse components

In React, your application comprises of components. Ideally, you start with building small components like buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, menus, etc. and create wrapper components around these smaller components.

And as you go on writing the higher level wrapper components, you will have a single root component and several hierarchical components. Now, here’s a no brainer: each component in React has its own logic. So if you want to re-use the button component through your app, you are good to go. I am pretty much confident everybody wants reusability in their project. Now you know which library offers that, don’t you?

Here’s an image illustrating component reusability in React:

It provides a unique Abstraction Layer

Another lesser-known business-related benefit with React is that it allows for a good abstraction layer, which means an end-user can’t access the complex internals. Your developer only needs to be aware of some basics, and they’d better off knowing the internal functionalities.

Moreover, it does not dictate any architectural patterns like MVC, MVP, and MVVM. Your developer is free to design an app’s architecture in any way he sees fit.

It’s well established with a vibrant ecosystem of Developer tools.

React consists of rich and vibrant ecosystem. Developers can find dozens of ready-made and customizable charts, graphics, documentation tools, and other components that allow them to build a web app in lesser time without reinventing the wheel. There’s this awesome collection of Reactjs dev tools and tutorials that help developers to build awesome stuffs.
